Small blog

This small blog has been realized during my degree in programming at EPHEC

The source code is based on the course of mongoDB lecon 7 I followed at [MongoDB University](https://university.mongodb.com/courses/schedule) and the code look to be without licence but I suppose it's a MIT licence...

The code is Heroky ready. Just push it and configure some variable:

- MONGOLAB_URI
- NODE_ENV
- REDISCLOUD_URL
- SESSION_SECRET
- STRONGLOOP_KEY

The code is using [Express js](http://expressjs.com) and specialy [Loopback](http://loopback.io)

If you prefer a great Node js blog engine, I suggest you to use [Hexo](http://hexo.io)

## What you need

You need to use a MongoDB server and a Redis server for the session

## after install

You need to create an account, this blog is one account only, so after that creation you cannot create an other account anymore.

## text edition

The Text should be writen in Markdown only
