Small blog

This small blog has been realized during my degree in programming at EPHEC

The source code is based on the course of mongoDB lecon 7 I followed at [MongoDB University](https://university.mongodb.com/courses/schedule) and the code look to be without licence but I suppose it's a MIT licence...

The code is Heroky ready. Just push it and configure some variable:

- MONGOLAB_URI
- NODE_ENV
- REDISCLOUD_URL
- SESSION_SECRET
- STRONGLOOP_KEY

The code is using [Express js](http://expressjs.com) and specialy [Loopback](http://loopback.io)
